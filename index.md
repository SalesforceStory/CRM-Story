C-R-M stands for “Customer Relationship Management.”

With a CRM application, there’s no secret formula. It simply manages most of your critical customer
information so that you can see it all in one place. Without leaving the app, you can view contact info, follow
up via email or social media, manage tasks, and track your performance, among other benefits. Implementing
the right CRM can increase sales efficiency. You can close more deals, boost sales, and improve forecast accuracy
